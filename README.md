# CPPND: Memory Management Chatbot

This is the project for the third course in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213): Memory Management.

The ChatBot project creates a dialogue where users can ask questions about some aspects of memory management in C++. After the knowledge base of the chatbot has been loaded from a text file, a knowledge graph representation is created in computer memory, where chatbot answer represent the graph nodes and user queries represent the graph edges. After a user query has been send to the chatbot, the Levenshtein distance is used to identify the most probable answer. The code is fully functional as-is and uses raw pointers to represent the knowledge graph and interconnections between objects throughout the project.

There are two major student tasks in the memory management course, which are:
1. to replace raw pointers with smart pointers where necessary according to the course guidelines and
2. to apply the Rule of Five to the ChatBot class to enable the use of move semantics to transport the ChatBot instance from node to node during a dialogue with the user.
